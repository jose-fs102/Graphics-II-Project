# Graphics II Project
Class: Graphics II 

Project: Graphics Project

Author: Jose Rivera



This project was given to me by my instructor in order to teach me how the graphics pipeline works. This project was coded from scratch by me with the exception of the xtime class and .dds loader class.



I implemented the .obj model loading and texture loading. I implemented the lighting and sky box as well. The Skyrim Logo has tessellation applied to it as well.
