Class: Structure of Game Design

WARNING: Game may or may not build in Visual studio. Please use the GameProject.exe to 
run the game. 

With this project, I was tasked with designing a game and developing it using the
sample code my instructor gave me. It included "Wrapper" classes that held much of the 
game functionality such as rendering, audio and input. I had to implement the gameplay and 
the flow of the game in code.

This game was supposed to teach us of sprite animations, game states, and the math behind the sprites such as
collision detection between sprites.
